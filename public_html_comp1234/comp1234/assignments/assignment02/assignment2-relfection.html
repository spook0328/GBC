        <h3>
          1. What challenges did you encounter while creating the folder
          structure and linking to files and directories?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I'm doing well with the folder structure and linking to files.
          However, I still had some problems when I uploaded the code to
          Filezila. Sometimes the server shouted down for no reason, forcing me
          to wait hours before reloading files. After that, I'll check all the
          files and folders are successful updates. That is the most challenging
          thing during this assignment.
        </p>
        <h3>
          2. How did you approach troubleshooting and debugging any broken links
          or references?
        </h3>
        <p>
          When I found any broken links or references. There are several
          debugging steps I will use. First, I used the HTML checker to find the
          errors. If there are no errors showing, I'll recheck carefully every
          folder and document name. Make sure that it should be the upper case
          or lower case. Finally, find the errors and fix them to the right
          names.
        </p>
        <h3>
          3. What did you learn about the relationship between HTML and file
          structure in web development projects?
        </h3>
        <p>
          In web development, the relationship between HTML and file structure
          is essential for organization and maintainability. First, I learn to
          focus on the upper or lower cases that will enforce all the structure.
          Then, CSS have three different ways to change the HTML and I need to
          find some way to figure the problems. the absolute path, another using
          root-relative, and the last one using document-relative.
        </p>
        <h3>
          4. What did you find most challenging about the assignment, and how
          did you overcome it?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I think the most challenging thing was the need to submit on Filezila.
          Although sometimes the HTML checker checks correctly, it still got
          some errors when I uploaded on Filezila. I need to check every
          document's update time to make sure that the updates are successful or
          not. But it was really satisfying when the assignment final came out,
          and I am so enjoying this coding assignment.
