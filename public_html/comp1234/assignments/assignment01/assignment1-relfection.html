      1. What challenges did you encounter while creating the folder structure
      and linking to files and directories?
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm doing well with the folder structure and linking to files. but I got
      some problems on uploading to Filezila. Sometimes the server shouted down
      for no reason and I need to wait couple of hours to reupload again.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. How did you approach troubleshooting and debugging any broken links or
      references?
    </p>
    <p>
      When I found any vroken links or references. I rechecked carfully every
      folder and documents name. Make sure that it should be the Upper case or
      lower case.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. What did you learn about the relationship between HTML and file
      structure in web development projects?
    </p>
    <p>
      In web development, the relationship between HTML and file structure is
      essential for organization and maintainability. First, I learn you need to
      focus on the upper or lower cases that will enforce all the structure.
      Then, their three different ways can link to the reference. One is using
      the absolute path, another using root-relative, and the last one using
      document-relative.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. What did you find most challenging about the assignment, and how did
      you overcome it?
    </p>
    <p>
      I think the most challenging thing was the need to submit on Filezila.
      Although sometimes the HTML checker checks correctly, it still got some
      errors when I uploaded on Filezila. I need to check every document's
      update time to make sure that the updates are successful or not.
