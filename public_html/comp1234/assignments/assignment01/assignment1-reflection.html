      1. What challenges did you encounter while creating the folder structure
      and linking to files and directories?
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm doing well with the folder structure and linking to files. However, I
      still had some problems when I uploaded the code to Filezila. Sometimes
      the server shouted down for no reason, forcing me to wait hours before
      reloading files. After that, I'll check all the files and folders are
      successful updates. That is the most challenging thing during this
      assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. How did you approach troubleshooting and debugging any broken links or
      references?
    </p>
    <p>
      When I found any broken links or references. There are several debugging
      steps I will use. First, I used the HTML checker to find the errors. If
      there are no errors showing, I'll recheck carefully every folder and
      document name. Make sure that it should be the upper case or lower case.
      Finally, find the errors and fix them to the right names.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. What did you learn about the relationship between HTML and file
      structure in web development projects?
    </p>
    <p>
      In web development, the relationship between HTML and file structure is
      essential for organization and maintainability. First, I learn you need to
      focus on the upper or lower cases that will enforce all the structure.
      Then, their three different ways can link to the reference. One is using
      the absolute path, another using root-relative, and the last one using
      document-relative.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. What did you find most challenging about the assignment, and how did
      you overcome it?
    </p>
    <p>
      I think the most challenging thing was the need to submit on Filezila.
      Although sometimes the HTML checker checks correctly, it still got some
      errors when I uploaded on Filezila. I need to check every document's
      update time to make sure that the updates are successful or not. But it
      was really satisfying when the assignment final came out, and I am so
      enjoying this coding assignment.
